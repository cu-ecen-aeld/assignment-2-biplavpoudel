/*
 * An alternative to the “writer.sh” test script created in assignment1 and using File IO as described in LSP chapter 2.
 * Additional instructions:
 * 1. One difference from the write.sh instructions in Assignment 1:
 *    You do not need to make your "writer" utility create directories which do not exist.  You can assume the directory is created by the caller.
 * 2. Setup syslog logging for your utility using the LOG_USER facility.
 * 3. Use the syslog capability to write a message “Writing <string> to <file>” 
 * 	where <string> is the text string written to file (second argument) 
 * 	and <file> is the file created by the script.  This should be written with LOG_DEBUG level.
 * 4. Use the syslog capability to log any unexpected errors with LOG_ERR level.
